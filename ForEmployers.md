# Beginning

I'm starting a new GitHub account to showcase my programming abilities and understanding of programming fundamentals as a developer. 
I will begin with the basics, such as:

- Data types
- Variables
- Assignments
- Branches
- Loops
- Arrays
- Vectors
- Functions

From there, I will move on to intermediate topics, including:

- Basic algorithms
- Objects
- Classes
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Pointers
- Inheritance
- Recursion
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues

Finally, I will delve into more advanced topics, such as:

- Data structures
- Complex algorithms
- Graphs
- Data frames
- Dictionaries

Throughout this process, I will include terms and definitions, as I understand them, in hopes 
to provide deeper insights into how I think and approach programming.
I hope this documentation will be useful to any potential employer and provide a smoother integration into any team I may join.

I will be doing my best to keep a certain level of organization. Projects will be done mostly in python, and C#. The projects will increase in difficulty 
as I progess.
